# Learning-Data-Science
I am a beginner in Data Science. I have learnt Python3 few days back and want to apply it in Data Science.
In this repository, I will be uploading the codes that I practice from beginner level so that other learners can take help.
Thanks to "IBM data science professional certificate" on Coursera.
